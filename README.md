# A-Simple-Language-Compiler
A compiler in C++ for an imperative language called "A Simple Language". It comes with a synthax lexer & parser, type checker, symbols table and code generation (which is executable using a virtual machine called TVM). 

This project uses and expands upon a basic antlr grammar & visitor framework. It also uses a virtual machine environment for code linking and execution. All documentation here: https://www.cs.upc.edu/~cl/practica/
